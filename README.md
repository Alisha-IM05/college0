## Local Setup (Run the Website on Your Computer)

### Requirements
Make sure you have these installed:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (comes with Python)

### Step 1 — Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alisha-IM05/college0.git
cd college0
```

### Step 2 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install flask
```

### Step 3 — Set up the database
```bash
python3 database/db.py
```
This creates the SQLite database file with all the tables.

### Step 4 — Run the website
```bash
python3 app.py
```
Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## How the Code Is Connected

Each person writes logic in their own `modules/` file.
When one module needs another person's function, it simply imports it:

```python
# Example: Tanzina's semester.py calling Alisha's warning function
from modules.conduct import issue_warning

issue_warning(instructor_id, "Course cancelled due to low enrollment")
```

`app.py` connects all the modules together and starts the server.
`database/db.py` is the single shared database connection everyone uses.

---

## Git Workflow

Everyone works on their own branch and opens a pull request to merge into `main`.

```bash
# Start your work
git checkout -b your-name-feature

# Save your work
git add .
git commit -m "description of what you did"
git push origin your-name-feature
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub → Alisha reviews → merges into `main`.

**Never push directly to `main`.**
